  - errcheck # checking for unchecked errors, these unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases
  - gosimple # specializes in simplifying a code
  - govet # reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
  - ineffassign # detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
  - staticcheck # is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks
  - unused # checks for unused constants, variables, functions and types
  - asasalint # checks for pass []any as any in variadic func(...any)
  - asciicheck # checks that your code does not contain non-ASCII identifiers
  - bidichk # checks for dangerous unicode character sequences
  - bodyclose # checks whether HTTP response body is closed successfully
  - durationcheck # checks for two durations multiplied together
  - errname # checks that sentinel errors are prefixed with the Err and error types are suffixed with the Error
  - errorlint # finds code that will cause problems with the error wrapping scheme introduced in Go 1.13
  - exportloopref # checks for pointers to enclosing loop variables
  - forbidigo # forbids identifiers
  - gocritic # provides diagnostics that check for bugs, performance and style issues
  - goimports # in addition to fixing imports, goimports also formats your code in the same style as gofmt
  - gomoddirectives # manages the use of 'replace', 'retract', and 'excludes' directives in go.mod
  - gomodguard # allow and block lists linter for direct Go module dependencies. This is different from depguard where there are different block types for example version constraints and module recommendations
  - goprintffuncname # checks that printf-like functions are named with f at the end
  - gosec # inspects source code for security problems
  - loggercheck # checks key value pairs for common logger libraries (kitlog,klog,logr,zap)
  - makezero # finds slice declarations with non-zero initial length
  - nakedret # finds naked returns in functions greater than a specified function length
  - nestif # reports deeply nested if statements
  - nilerr # finds the code that returns nil even if it checks that the error is not nil
  - nilnil # checks that there is no simultaneous return of nil error and an invalid value
  - noctx # finds sending http request without context.Context
  - nonamedreturns # reports all named returns
  - nosprintfhostport # checks for misuse of Sprintf to construct a host with port in a URL
  - predeclared # finds code that shadows one of Go's predeclared identifiers
  - promlinter # checks Prometheus metrics naming via promlint
  - reassign # checks that package variables are not reassigned
  - stylecheck # is a replacement for golint
  - tenv # detects using os.Setenv instead of t.Setenv since Go1.17
  - testableexamples # checks if examples are testable (have an expected output)
  - tparallel # detects inappropriate usage of t.Parallel() method in your Go test codes
  - unconvert # removes unnecessary type conversions
  - unparam # reports unused function parameters
  - usestdlibvars # detects the possibility to use variables/constants from the Go standard library
